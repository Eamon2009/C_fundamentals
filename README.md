## Project Status

Active development in this repository is currently paused as my primary focus for now is Python ,AI-oriented projects and school annual exams [ending-2march/2026]

This repository represents foundational work in C programming and will be expanded in the near future to include advanced topics such as pointers, memory management, and data structures.
